üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user need not set up their own environment variables at this point in time.

Create an account on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to get preset value and cloudinary url.

Create a `.env` file on your root directory and the following lines

`REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_PRESET=<Preset value gotten from cloudinary>`
`REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_URL=<API Base URL gotten from cloudinary>`

You can also check the `.env.example` to see how your `.env` should look like

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Testing

### Front-end:

#### Jest

# Installation Instructions

To get a local version of the Tieme Ndo app up and running, make sure you have a copy of the local server running, in addition to running the front-end app.

To get the server up and running, do the following:

```
    git clone https://github.com/tieme-ndo/backend.git
    cd backend
    yarn install
```

Now, all packages will get installed. Depending on how fast your machine is, this can take up to a couple of minutes. As soon as it's finished, run the following to start the server:

```
    yarn start
```

To get the front-end, you should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
    git clone https://github.com/tieme-ndo/frontend.git
    cd frontend
    yarn install
```

Once again, the installation will take anywhere between 30 seconds and a minute or two. To get the front-end running, run:

```
    yarn start
```

## Other Scripts

    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory and `.test.js` and `.spec.js` files
    * eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
