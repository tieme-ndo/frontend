# Installation Instructions

To get a local version of the Tieme Ndo app up and running, make sure you have a copy of the local server running, in addition to running the front-end app.

To get the server up and running, do the following:
```
    git clone https://github.com/tieme-ndo/backend.git
    cd backend
    yarn install
```

Now, all packages will get installed. Depending on how fast your machine is, this can take up to a couple of minutes. As soon as it's finished, run the following to start the server:

```
    yarn start
```

To get the front-end, you should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
    git clone https://github.com/tieme-ndo/frontend.git
    cd frontend
    yarn install
```

Once again, the installation will take anywhere between 30 seconds and a minute or two. To get the front-end running, run: 

```
    yarn start
```

## Other Scripts
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory and `.test.js` and `.spec.js` files
    * eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
